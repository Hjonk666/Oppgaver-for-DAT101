      <li>[What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?]</li>
      <p>[Invoking a function means calling on something we made earlier - the function will be run. 
        Creating a function effectively does nothing until said function is invoked; 
        it simply sits there as waiting code not even read by the program]</p>
      <li>[Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.]</li>
      <p>[Semicolon is used to denote the end of a code block or line; it declares this part over so the code will move on to the next part of the code without linking the "current" and next commands.]</p>
      <li>[What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?]</li>
      <p>[]</p>When no values are returned from a function, it's "output" will automatically become "undefined"
      <li>[How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?]</li>
      <p>[]</p>By placing commas between them within the parentheses.
      <li>[Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.]</li>
      <p>[]</p>their names are used like variables within their function, which is why they are important upon creation. On invocation, they're used to denote which order each variable's value is written.
      <li>[Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.]</li>
      <p>[]</p>Because the function hasn't been given a value to stand inn for the parameter, and it won't assign one, 
      it becomes undefined. This can be useful when adding multiple uses for a function (printing a name and a date), 
      as the use requiring the undefined variable simply isn't executed and so won't return errors when lacking data.
      <li>[Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.]</li>
      <p>[When using recursive functions, you're invoking a function within itself. Effectively,
        this means that within the function it will call upon itself and repeat itself to use the 
        "final" value within itself again. Unless you put inn a way to break this, it may become an
        infinite loop where the code simply keeps going back and repeating the function in infinite layers]</p>
