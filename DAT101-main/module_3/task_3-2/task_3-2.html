      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[It is indeed possible, as I demonstrated in my own writing of the task. 
        It only depends on what you place inside to get repeated]</p>
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer.]</li>
      <p>[It is definitely possible to create an infinite loop - 
        all one has to do is set a condition which the while loop cannot meet. 
        Using my own answer as an example, the while loop continues to run until 
        the program manages to guess the correct number. If that number is set above 60, it will continue looping forever as the program only guesses between 1 and 60]</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p> [Well, since the loop is infinite it will take "forever" to compute - however as we're using 
        html code it becomes obvious there's a problem when the result refuses to load; the computer knows
        it's not done and will keep running until the loop is over. This is instantly noticeable due to 
        how insanely fast the computer tends to finish when the loop is closed] </p>
      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?]</li>
      <p>[At least with how *I* completed the task where we used nested for loops to make a table, I do not
        believe changing around the order is possible; the system relies on each colum adding it's entry on the row before reaching
        the end and resetting to the start. The repetition of any printOut command will result in a new row, and solid
        the row command must be the outer layer.]</p>
