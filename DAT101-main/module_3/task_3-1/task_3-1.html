      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When WakeUpTime is equal to 7, the script runs as expected by printing the text. In any other circumstance, the script will stop as the if condition is not met.]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[With the addition of an else statement, when the variable doesn't match the "desired" value the script will keep running to print the "otherwise" text (I'll take the car rather than I can take the bus)]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[So long as wake time is equal to one of the 'desired' values, the script prints it's response. Should the value be over 8 or under 7 it will print the car response.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[The result when the number is exactly 0 depends on how you wrote the if condition; by writing it as <= for example, it will declare positive so long as the number is equal or greater.
