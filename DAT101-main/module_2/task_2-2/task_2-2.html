    <ol>
      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[Constants should be used when the value you declare should remain fixed - for safety of a formula, for example, where the outcome must be the same regardless of other changes]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[Parentheses in math reassign the order of operations - by using them, the inside will always be done first and so can alter the outcome of arithmetic expressions]
        [For example, while 2 * 6 + 2 = 14, parentheses make it 2 * (6 + 2) = 16 ]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[To limit floating point numbers we can use the toFixed function, followed by the number of decimals we want. For example, number.toFixed(1) will mean there is only one decimal point]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparing two values, specifically when checking if they're equal, is done by using the == function, which compares the values. If you use = it is an error as that means you're declaring them equal. This will return a True/false value]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparison operators return true and false values; for example,  1 < 2 will return true. We can check this by making the program print a line with that as a variable; Check = 1 < 2; printOut("The result is " + Check)]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[It works by generating a "random" number between values you declare, such as Math.random(1, 10) which will give between 1 and 9. It can be used to randomize the results of an equation, especially useful for things like games of chance.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[Modulus is an operator that gives you the "rest" after an equation. For example, 30 hours can be divided into 1.4 days, but you can use modulus to take the left over (or not whole) numbers to separate it into one day and 6 hours.]
