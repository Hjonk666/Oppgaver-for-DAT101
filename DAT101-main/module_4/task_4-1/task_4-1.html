      <li>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[Object-oriented development is important because it organizes code into reusable objects, making it easier to manage, extend, and maintain complex systems by modeling real-world entities and their interactions.]</p>
      
      <li>[In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development.]</li>
      <p>[The "AccountType" static object stores predefined account types, making it easier to manage and standardize types across the application. This approach reduces errors, centralizes control, and makes the code more maintainable by avoiding hard-coded values.]</p>
      
      <li>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>
      <p>[Encapsulation is used to protect data and limit access to certain parts of a class, making code safer and reducing unintended interactions. We create "private" members using # or _ prefixes (e.g., #balance), while "public" members are simply declared without these prefixes.]</p>

      <li>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>
      <p>[Using "new" in JavaScript creates a new instance of an object based on a constructor function, initializing it with its own scope and properties, and returning it as an instance of that class.]</p>
